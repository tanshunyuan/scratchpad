## [How To Make Agents Talk to Each Other](https://www.copilotkit.ai/blog/how-to-make-agents-talk-to-each-other-and-your-app-using-a2a-ag-ui)

This is more of a run through than tutorial, when you clone both the repos everything is already set up. So there is not much you need to code, which isn't that useful.
Also, while its great that AG-UI and CopilotKit are used they are too heavily abstracted for people who wants to understand how the server integrates with the UI.

Maybe following a tutorial from a2a protocol could've been more beneficial, such as  https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples/tree/main/demo

One more thing, seems like copilotkit is kind of complex and not everything is stylable like Vercel elements which might be annoying for some
